# Difference Between CSS and SCSS

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a styling language used to define the presentation of HTML documents.

**SCSS (Sassy CSS)** is a CSS preprocessor, which means it adds extra features to CSS, such as:

- Variables  
- Mixins  
- Functions  
- Nesting

These features are not available in plain CSS.

> SCSS needs to be compiled into CSS before it can be used in a browser.
